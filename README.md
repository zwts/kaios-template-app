It's a pure KaiOS app, uses Preact + TypeScript + Webpack4 to build and pack the app. The build step will place the bundled scripts under 'src/' folder into the `<body>` tag.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Builds the app for development to the `dist` folder.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn prod`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
